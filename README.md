  synopsis: |
    As a seasoned tech enthusiast, my voyage has spanned from assembling PCs
    and establishing ISPs, to orchestrating vast VoIP systems and crafting 
    intricate IPTV architectures. My knack for problem-solving and passion for 
    tinkering serve as my compass in this tech odyssey.

wisdom: 
  - The truth is in the packets
  - The simplest problems are the most evasive
  - There are two ways to indent, "Tabs" and "Wrong"
  - I would indent this with tabs but I can't because it's YAML
